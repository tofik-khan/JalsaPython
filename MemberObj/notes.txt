I have created the basic structure for the class, we can expand on this onces we implement the sections. 
I have divided the sections, please select a section and work on it.

For the Getters and Setter functions look into the python Property decorator

For the Jamat validation look for a library that will validate the city

For the exception try to create a switch to return the correct error message
